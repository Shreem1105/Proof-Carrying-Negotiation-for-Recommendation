Figure 2: Headline Results (Feasible Users, n=551, W=80). (a) PCN-Rec achieves near-perfect governance (98.6% pass rate) compared to the Single LLM baseline (0.0%). Pass rate measures constraint satisfaction; Single LLM often violates constraints even when feasible solutions exist. (b) This massive gain in compliance comes with only a minor utility cost (NDCG drop of 0.022), remaining competitive with the deterministic greedy bound.
